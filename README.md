# Recepty 🍽️

A simple online cookbook where everyone can contribute their recipes!

## 📌 About the Project

**Recepty** is my first project, where I am learning basic development skills using JavaScript. The goal is to create an easy-to-use online cookbook where users can add their favorite recipes through a JavaScript-handled form.

Currently, the project uses **Supabase** as the backend, but in the future, I plan to develop my own database.

## 🚀 Features

- Users can add recipes through a form.
- Recipes are stored in **Supabase**.
